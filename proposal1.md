# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pokemon Tower Defense

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A tower defense game that uses pokemon as the towers which evolve as they are upgraded

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The goal of my project is to make a tower defense like game. It will allow you to choose and place different towers to fend off the coming waves of enemies before they can damage your base. It will have the ability to upgrade these characters with the money you earn from killing enemies. It will also have the ability to keep track of how many enemies are left to know when to send in another wave of enemies. I plan to excecute this idea through a game engine like unity or unreal. I plan to make it a simple 2D game that uses sprites of pokemon which will evolve upon being upgraded.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Core mechanics of a tower defense game, atleast one wave of moving "enemies", attacks that damage and can kill enemies, ability to place and select different towers and a "base" with a limited amount of health.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All previously listed features aswell as a money system, more waves of enemies (which will vary in type), upgrades/evolution with interfaces when the tower is selected. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All the features in the last two outcomes aswell as visually appealing graphics, a boss wave at the end, and a home screen before you get into the game with settings and such.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will be to learn how to make a game with game engines. I will need to aquire this skill and many others that fall other the same catagory to be able to bring this game together. I will need to research how I can keep track of health bars and money in games. I also need to research how to work with graphics in a game engine because that is something that is new to me. There will be lots of skills that I hope to develop with this project relating to how games are made which is why I wanted to do something like this. Another important thing I will need to learn is how to make things move along a specific path within a game engine.
